# Review from Feya

## Reproducibility report

*It is easy to reproduce the project without single change in my case (Mac user). However in other systems this: *cd Mini_project* I guess should be exactly like the project's name: Mini_Project (however this is my guess, as it ran smoothly from my Mac)*

## Overall opinion

- Reproducibility: Perfect, I had no issue to reproduce the project in my VS Code.

- Clean documentation: Everything is documented, readme file is easy to understand. Maybe direct link to database can be added rather than website.

- Coding style: I like how its easy to read the codes and run them. Also outcome is saved in the output file.

- Use of git:The folder structure is well-organized (data/, notebooks/, src/, output/), which shows thoughtful planning before committing. Readme file explains how to reproduce the project, I found it impressive and realised I had to do this as well.

## Rate

I would rate with highest point as project achieved its goal - to reproduce it easely with no stuggles.

## Suggested improvements

- direct link of dataset can be added to readme along with OSF link

- three upper dots are useful to make folder stucture look same as in your code (I found it nice)
